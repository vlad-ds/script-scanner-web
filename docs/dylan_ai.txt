introducing Dylan AI: Insightful Script Analysis for Informed Decisions

COPY

Okay, understood. Targeting producers and executives requires a shift in focus from creative development feedback (for the writer) to evaluation efficiency, decision support, and risk assessment (for the producer/exec).

Let's refine the naming and rewrite the landing page copy with this crucial audience in mind.

Phase 1: Product Name Ideas (Producer/Exec Focus)
The previous names can still work, but let's re-evaluate with the producer perspective:

Script Insight AI: Still strong. Producers need quick, reliable insights.
AI Script Coverage Pro: Clear, functional. "Pro" implies professional use.
Script Scanner Analysis Pro: Leverages existing brand, focuses on analysis which producers need.
Script Assess AI: Directly speaks to the evaluation function producers perform. Clear and functional.
Exec Coverage AI: Targets the audience directly, though maybe a bit limiting.
Coverage Compass AI: Implies guidance for decision-making.
Recommendation:

Script Insight AI, AI Script Coverage Pro, and Script Assess AI seem like the strongest contenders now.
Script Insight AI is concise and benefit-driven.
AI Script Coverage Pro clearly states what it is and who it's for.
Script Assess AI is very direct about its core function for this audience.
Let's continue using [Product Name] in the copy.
